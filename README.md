# Sales Offer Prediction Model

This project implements a machine learning solution to predict whether a customer will take up a sales offer when cold-called. The solution uses XGBoost for prediction and provides a REST API using Starlette for model serving, along with comprehensive analysis and PDF report generation.

- Make
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Core Dependencies

- numpy, pandas: Data manipulation
- scikit-learn: Machine learning utilities
- xgboost: Core prediction model
- starlette, uvicorn: API serving
- matplotlib, seaborn: Visualization
- reportlab, pillow: PDF report generation
- pytest: Unit testing

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd sales-offer-prediction
```

2. Build the Docker images:

```bash
make build
```

> **Note**: If you encounter Docker network issues, you can install dependencies locally with `pip install -r requirements.txt` and run commands without Docker.

## Usage

### Available Commands

Run `make help` to view all available commands:

```bash
make help
```

### Training and Analysis Workflow

The recommended workflow is:

1. **Build the Docker images** (if not done already):

   ```bash
   make build
   ```

2. **Train the model and run analysis**:

   ```bash
   make analyze
   ```

   This will train the XGBoost model and generate analysis outputs.

3. **Generate PDF report from analysis results**:

   ```bash
   make generate-pdf-report    # Local Python
   # OR
   make generate-docker-pdf-report    # Using Docker
   ```

4. **Combined training and report generation**:

   ```bash
   make analyze-with-report     # Local Python for report
   # OR
   make analyze-with-docker-report    # Docker for report
   ```

5. **View the results**:

   ```bash
   make view-analysis    # View JSON analysis
   make view-metrics     # View model metrics
   ```

   You can also directly view:
   - Analysis JSON: `models/analysis/analysis_report.json`
   - PDF Report: `models/analysis/model_analysis_report.pdf`
   - Performance Plots: `models/plots/`

### Fixing JSON Serialization Issues

If you encounter JSON serialization issues with NumPy types:

```bash
make fix-json

## Model Performance

Current model metrics (as of latest training):

- Accuracy: 91.49%
- Precision: 64.60%
- Recall: 53.63%
- F1 Score: 58.60%
- Optimal threshold: 0.084 (TPR: 94.40%, FPR: 16.06%)

## Financial Impact Analysis

The model includes risk-based financial impact analysis:

- Risk bands: High (10%), Medium (25%), Low (65%)
- Profit/loss matrix per risk band
- Campaign size analysis (default: 10,000 customers)
- Opportunity loss calculation

## PDF Report Generation

The project generates comprehensive PDF reports that include:

- Data quality assessment and summary statistics
- Feature relevance analysis with mutual information and importance scores
- Class balance analysis with distributions
- Model performance metrics and visualization
- Financial impact analysis with risk-band breakdown

Images in the report are automatically scaled to fit the page width while maintaining their aspect ratio, ensuring optimal readability.

To view the generated PDF report:

```bash
# For Linux/macOS
open models/analysis/model_analysis_report.pdf

# For Windows
start models/analysis/model_analysis_report.pdf
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing Dependencies**:
   - Ensure all requirements are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - For image handling issues, verify Pillow is installed

2. **Docker Build Failures**:
   - Network issues: Try running commands without Docker
   - Memory issues: Increase Docker's allocated memory in settings

3. **Report Generation Issues**:
   - If images don't appear: Check `models/plots` directory for PNG files
   - For JSON serialization errors: Run `make fix-json` to fix the analysis report

4. **API Request Formatting**:
   - Ensure all features are included and properly encoded
   - Refer to the feature mapping table for correct encodings

### Getting Help

For additional issues, please:

1. Check the logs in the terminal output
2. Examine the generated JSON files for any error messages
3. Create an issue in the repository with detailed information about the problem
